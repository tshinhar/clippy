# clippy
this is a clipboard history managmet script.

to use it just run the script, then a window will open with a text box that will contain the last 10 times that was coppied to the clipboard.

you can select any part of this text and use the copy botton to get the selected text to the clipboard.

please note that while the script is fully functional (and pretty useful) it is mainly a POC and probably needs a lot more work to make it production-ready
